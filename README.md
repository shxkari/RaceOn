# RaceOn
Some code written to control a self driving car using a Raspberry Pi and a Pi Camera


The entire environment is attached as a zip file

It might not work exactly with your setup. Note the kind of car you have and the angle of your camera and height of your camera. 

The scripts uploaded to the GitHub repo are cleaned up versions of what you will find in 

raceon_lap2.py = raceon--> pwmpy --> EbraFail.ipynb
racedaychanges.py = raceon--> pwmpy --> slowandsteadywinstherace-raceready-final-aggro-2.ipynb

To get a copy of the entire environment we used download raceon.zip 
Ignore stupid file names and generally unogranized files everywhere...
